# pneumonia-cnn
Pneumonia Detection AI: We build an AI tool to help radiologists and patients detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Leveraging CNNs and transfer learning (VGG16, ResNet50), we preprocess and explore data, optimize models, and evaluate performance via accuracy and confusion matrices.

# Pneumonia-CNN 

A collection of Colab notebooks and Python scripts for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning and transfer learning.
